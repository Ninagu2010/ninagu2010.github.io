Today I learned a new word called secede and regiment 



regiment means a permanent unit of an army typically commanded by a lieutenant colonel and divided into several companies, squadrons, or batteries and often into two battalions



secede means withdraw formally from membership of a federal union, an alliance, or a political or religious organization.
