Today I learnt 2 words called thermal energy & omnivore



**Thermal energy** is the internal **energy** of an object due to the kinetic **energy** of its atoms and/or molecules. The atoms and/or molecules of a hotter object have greater kinetic **energy** than those of a colder one, in the form of vibrational, rotational, or, in the case of a gas, translational motion.

Omnivore means an animal or person that eats a variety of food of both plant and animal origin.
