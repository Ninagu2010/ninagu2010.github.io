Yesterday we had a campfire, because it was a cold night. Our dogs were there to because they felt cold too the fire wasn't really going because of the wood. First we put pine cones and pine cone needles into the fire pit. Then we got a lighter then lit the pine cones and pine cone needles it made a huge fire then we put the wood in the fire pit
