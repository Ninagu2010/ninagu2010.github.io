Today I learnt a new word called hydrometer & sieve



sieve means a utensil consisting of a wire or plastic mesh held in a frame, used for straining solids from liquids, for separating coarser from finer particles, or for reducing soft solids to a pulp.



hydrometer means an instrument for measuring the density of liquids
