Today I learnt a word called niche & molecule



niche means 

a shallow recess, especially one in a wall to display a statue or other ornament

And another word called molecule



molecule means a group of atoms bonded together, representing the smallest fundamental unit of a chemical compound that can take part in a chemical reaction.
