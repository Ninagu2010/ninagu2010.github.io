Today I learnt a word called sextant &  ultraviolet radiation 



A sextant means an instrument with a graduated arc of 60Â° and a sighting mechanism, used for measuring the angular distances between objects and especially for taking altitudes in navigation and surveying.

Ultraviolet radiation is electromagnetic **radiation** or light having a wavelength greater than 100 nm but less than 400 nm. ... **Ultraviolet radiation** has a wavelength longer than that of x-rays but shorter than that of visible light.
