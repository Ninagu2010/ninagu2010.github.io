Today I learnt a word called structural adaptation & behavioural adaptation



Structural adaptation means are physical features of an organism like the bill on a bird or the fur on a bear. Other **adaptations** are behavioural. Behavioural **adaptations** are the things organisms do to survive. ... **Adaptations** usually occur because a gene mutates or changes by accident



Behavioural adaptations are the things organisms do to survive
