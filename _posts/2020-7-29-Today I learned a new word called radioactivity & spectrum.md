radioactivity means the emission of ionizing radiation or particles caused by the spontaneous disintegration of atomic nuclei. radioactive substances, or the radiation emitted by these.



spectrum means a band of colours, as seen in a rainbow, produced by separation of the components of light by their different degrees of refraction according to wavelength
