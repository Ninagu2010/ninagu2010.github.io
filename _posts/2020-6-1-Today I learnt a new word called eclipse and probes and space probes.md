Today I learnt a new word called eclipse and probes



Eclipse means an obscuring of the light from one celestial body by the passage of another between it and the observer or between it and its source of illumination

Probes means A blunt-ended surgical instrument used for exploring a wound or part of the body

Or the space probe is a unmanned craft which is sent into **space** to **do** research. When we want to get close up pictures and information about the planets, moons, comets, and asteroids in our Solar System, we send out **space probes**. **Space probes can** carry special cameras and instruments far out into the solar system.
