Today at home



Today in the morning we had toast sandwich's after that we cleaned the downstairs because it was to dirty.



We washed the dogs and let them dry after that, we took the dogs on a walk to the park near our house. We saw a lady who found a electrical bike on the road. After that me and my dad saw a dog in the park that came from the house in the park, we came home and relaxed.
