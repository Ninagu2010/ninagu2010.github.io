On the holidays I went camping at Mount barney it was very fun.



We stood at the back tray when we went 4WD driving on different tracks.

1 morning we woke up at 5:40am to see the sunrise and that afternoon 5:30 we went to see the sunset it was very beautiful.

 And on the holidays we went to the hyperdome to see robins kitchen stuff e.g pans utensils, after that I bought a big lolly for $4 dollars and bought chicken sushi.
