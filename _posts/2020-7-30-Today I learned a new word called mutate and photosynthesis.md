Today I learned a new word called mutate and photosynthesis



photosynthesis means the process by which green plants and some other organisms use sunlight to synthesize nutrients from carbon dioxide and water. Photosynthesis in plants generally involves the green pigment chlorophyll and generates oxygen as a by-product



mutate means change in form or nature.
