Today at school



Today in Maths we had some word problems about am and pm. In English we had to write a opinion about Cane Toads for the rest of the day we just played and after second break we played Kahoot and I came 2nd place. Before First Break our teacher told us to go to the grade 3/4 area to eat and play because the 5/6 area was closed.



On the Holidays 



On the holidays we were supposed to go camping but because of the coronavirus we home camped. It was really fun I cooked a marshmallow and I got it burned. We also had a barbecue.
