Today I learnt a word called algae and pH



pH is a measure of how acidic/basic water is. The range goes from 0 to 14, with 7 being neutral. pHs of less than 7 indicate acidity, whereas a **pH** of greater than 7 indicates a base. The **pH** of water is a very important measurement concerning water quality.

algae means a simple, non-flowering, and typically aquatic plant of a large group that includes the seaweeds and many single-celled forms. Algae contain chlorophyll but lack true stems, roots, leaves, and vascular tissue.
